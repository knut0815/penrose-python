# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented. The versions to the right of the description correspond with pypi releases.
Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - changed behaviour

## [master](https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory/tree/master) (master)
 - Creation of skeleton (0.0.1)
